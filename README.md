NewsBlur Open in New Tab
========================

Safari 10 and later no longer support the method that the [NewsBlur](https://www.newsblur.com/) Web app uses to open stories in tabs.  This extension gives NewsBlur the ability to do so again.

This extension has been submitted to the [Safari Extensions Gallery](https://developer.apple.com/safari/extensions/) and will hopefully be available there soon, but for the moment, you can [download it](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nriley/OpenInNewTab/master/NewsBlurOpenInNewTab.safariextz) from this site.

After installing the extension, reload the NewsBlur tab if it's open, or just quit and reopen Safari.  You should then be able to use the 'o' or 'v' keys to open stories in new tabs.

If you have the NewsBlur Web app installed on your own server (i.e., if you do not access NewsBlur by going to newsblur.com), you can specify the domain of your own server in Safariâ€™s Preferences.  The extension will only work on this domain (and subdomains thereof).  You will need to reload/reopen the site after changing this domain.

Problems?  Please file a ticket.

Enjoy!
